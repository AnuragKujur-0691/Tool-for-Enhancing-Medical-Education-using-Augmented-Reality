# Tool-for-Enhancing-Medical-Education-using-Augmented-Reality

Through the use of Augmented Reality (AR) technology and computer vision methods in this project, we hope to come up with a new way to improve medical education. Our final goal is to make a learning environment where medical students can see and interact with real-time 3D models of the human body. The main goal is to create a site where students can interact with virtual organs and watch moving simulations, which will help them learn more about complicated body structures. Real-time data from a camera, such as points on the body and hand gestures, are fed into our system. The expected result is an augmented reality (AR) model of the human body with accurate organ placement and interactive features.
